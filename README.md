My Theme!

Features two varieties, the new default 'serenity' and the older 'void' theme which is a far more deep purple based theme with bright yellow highlights.

This features colorschemes for `neovim` as well as support for multiple other applications such as `tmux`, `ghostty`, `zellij` and `lazygit`.
